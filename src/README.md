# Fruit Dupe Finder

This Java project demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts using a simple fruit hierarchy. It includes classes for `Fruit`, `Apple`, and `Orange`, and provides functionality to find and sort duplicate fruits in a list.

## Features

- Defines `Apple` and `Orange` classes extending a base `Fruit` class.
- Implements custom `equals`, `hashCode`, and `compareTo` methods.
- Includes a `DupeFinder` utility to check for duplicate fruits and return sorted duplicates.
- Example usage in `Main.java`.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA or your preferred Java IDE.
3. Build and run `Main.java` to see the output.

## Project Structure

- `src/Apple.java` - Apple class implementation.
- `src/Orange.java` - Orange class implementation.
- `src/Fruit.java` - Base class for fruits.
- `src/DupeFinder.java` - Utility for finding duplicates.
- `src/Main.java` - Entry point with example usage.

## Requirements

- Java 8 or higher

## Usage

Run the `Main` class to see duplicate detection and sorting in action.
